# Welcome

**Hello world**, this is my first Jekyll blog post.

I hope you like it!



```python
# Python program to read
# file word by word

# opening the text file
with open('GFG.txt','r') as file:

	# reading each line
	for line in file:

		# reading each word	
		for word in line.split():

			# displaying the words		
			print(word)
            
```
